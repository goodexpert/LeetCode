# LeetCode Challenges in Multiple Programming Languages

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository!  
This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in multiple programming languages.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills while becoming fluent in different programming paradigms and syntax.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Strengthen algorithm and data structure fundamentals
- Practice solving the same problem in different programming languages
- Compare syntax and performance characteristics across languages
- Build consistency through daily problem solving

## 🛠️ Languages Used

This repository includes solutions in the following languages:

- ✅ C
- ✅ C#
- ✅ C++
- ✅ Java
- ✅ JavaScript
- ✅ Kotlin
- ✅ Python
- ✅ Swift
- ✅ TypeScript
- ... and more to come!

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each problem has its own folder, containing implementations in different languages.
File names indicate the language for clarity and easy navigation.
